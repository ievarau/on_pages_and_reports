# On Pages and Reports #

In this page you will find some useful information about how you can present your scientfic results to the community through creating webpages using GitHub Pages or Bitbucket.

Three strategies to create and deploy pages will be shown and discussed here:
1. Writing a page as `.html` and deploying on GitHub.
2. Writing a page as `.md` and deploying on GitHub through GitHub Pages.
3. Writing a page as `.html` and deploying on Bitbucket.

All 3 strategies will result in a page hosted by GitHub or Bitbucket. They have their own advantages, but also some disadvantages. Generally, I prefer to write the page as a Markdown (`.md`) document and deploy it using GitHub Pages, which is one of the GitHub actions. This way is probably the most convenient of all three, because GitHub will take care of deployment and some GitHub Pages specific items are really nice (for example, layout and theme of the page can be defined in the config - you can use one of the publicly available themes from Jekyll). Finally, I find it easier to write in Markdown, but if needed you can also use html syntax within `.md` document.

## 3. Writing a page as `.html` and deploying on Bitbucket ##

I think this is my least recommended option. Bitbucket does not have alternatives to GitHub Pages. There is [Hugo webpage](https://gohugo.com.cn/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-bitbucket/) that you could host on Bitbucket, but you then have to create [Aerobatics](https://github.com/aerobatic/aerobatic-cli) webpage, which will have a specific URL extension etc. Too much of a hassle :wink:.
